## ❓ What is Spotless?

Spotless is a general-purpose formatting plugin used by [6,000 projects on GitHub (Jan 2023)](https://github.com/search?l=Maven+POM&q=spotless&type=Code). It is completely à la carte, but also includes powerful "batteries-included" if you opt-in.

## ❓ Why Spotless?

There really isn’t a strong alternative.

Spotless is one of the very few formatting tools that works seamlessly with both Maven and Gradle, and can be integrated into Java projects without requiring new tooling ecosystems or language server configuration. It handles multi-format linting, supports widely accepted formatting styles (like Palantir Java Format), and is extremely customizable—yet doesn't get in your way.

If you’re coming from a frontend or Python world, tools like `prettier`, `black`, or `eslint` offer tight `pre-commit` integration out of the box. In the `Java` ecosystem, that level of integration is oddly lacking. `Spotless` fills that gap with the added benefit of being language-agnostic across file types.

## 📚 Plugin Documentation

To find out more information about the `spotless-maven-plugin`, please refer to the [Spotless Maven Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-maven/README.md). This will give you more information about the configuration options available to you. The configuration options laid out above are a full-fat recommended configuration. All the sections might not apply to you, like the `sql` section. It is also strongly advised, if you are adding `spotless` to an existing project, to remove the `java` portion from the `spotless` configuration for a phase 1 migration. This way, you can start enforcing the `pre-commit` process and get formatting on some non-critical, non-java files. Once you are happy with the configuration, you can then add the `java` portion to the `spotless` configuration. This will allow you to get the formatting on the Java files without having to set up the overall configuration and process in one go.

## 📋 Pre-requisites

- Your project must be on `Java 11`
- Your project must have the `Maven Wrapper` configured

## 🧰 Maven Wrapper Setup

To add Maven wrapper to your project, run the following command: `mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.8.8`

You can do this in almost any IDE, since they often bundle Maven into the IDE itself. It is fine to continue using the bundled Maven when in the IDE, but we need the Maven Wrapper to perform `pre-commit` commands.

> You can keep using your IDE’s Maven integration for builds and testing, but pre-commit hooks must run through the Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`) to ensure consistency across environments. Additionally, for users who do **not** have Maven installed, the wrapper will download the correct version of Maven for them. Otherwise, this `pre-commit` process would **force** all developers to install yet another tool on their local machine. This is not ideal, and we want to avoid that if possible.

Despite the above warning, your IDEs built-in git process will also run these hooks. At the end of the day, these hooks simply go into your `.git/hooks/` directory and are run by git. So, if you are using IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code, the hooks will run as expected. The wrapper is purely for CLI needs.

## 🧾 Adding .gitattributes

If your project doesn't have a `.gitattributes` file, create one in the root of your project. Failure to do this, and messing up the line endings for `*.cmd` or the `mvnw` script files will cause issues for other developers on your team, even if you yourself don't experience any issues.

```gitattributes
/mvnw text eol=lf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
# Add other files here before the * text=auto
# *.png binary
# * text=auto should be the last line in the file
* text=auto
```

## ⚙️ Basic Plugin Setup

This section details how to configure `spotless` in your `pom.xml` file. We start off with the overall skeleton of the `plugin` within the `pom.xml` file, and then brerak out the different configurations for the different file types into their own section. It is recommended to add all the formatting configurations you want **except** Java formatting in the first phase. This way, you can get the `pre-commit` hooks set up and working, and then add the Java formatting in a second phase. This will allow you to get the formatting on the non-critical files first, and then add the Java formatting later.

### 🦴 Plugin Skeleton

Below is the overall skeleton of the `pom.xml` file. This is broken out here to show the overall high-level structure of the `spotless` configuration. The actual configurations for specific programming languages and file types are below in separate sections that are intended to be copied and pasted into the `spotless` plugin's `configuration` section, replacing the `...` in the `configuration` section.

        <version>${spotless.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ... <!-- This is where you will paste the configuration for the different file types below. You can quite literally copy and paste the sections below into this block, replacing the ... with what you copied -->
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>check</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      <!-- END PLUGIN CONFIG -->
      ...
      <!-- Other Plugins -->
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
```

</details>

An important callout here is that the `spotless` plugin has its `executions` block configured as follows:

```xml
<executions>
  <execution>
    <goals>
      <goal>check</goal>
    </goals>
  </execution>
</executions>
```

This has the side effect of making the CI/CD run the `spotless` check, **NOT** the `apply` goal. This checks that code was formatted with `spotless` in the CI/CD, but does not apply formatting, and instead, will fail the maven build if the code is not formatted correctly. This is a good practice to get into, as it will help you catch formatting issues before they hit your main branch, and identify developers not configuring their local development environment correctly.

#### 🗃️ "Formats" Configuration (Non-Code Files and Prettier)

Non-code files and `prettier` configuration is done in the `formats` block in the `configuration` section of the `spotless` plugin. This is where you can configure the files that you want to format with `prettier`, and any other non-code files that you want to format.

```xml
<formats>
  ... <!-- This is where you will paste the configuration for the different file types below. You can quite literally copy and paste the sections below into this block, replacing the ... with what you copied -->
</formats>
```

For now, you can copy this into the `spotless` plugin's `configuration` section, replacing the `...` in the `formats` block, and then later replacing the `...` in the `formats` block with the sub-sections found below.

##### 📄 Non-Code Files (Still Important!)

This is important because it not only enforces some minor trimming of whitespace and newlines, but also ensures that the `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files are properly formatted for the OS you are on. `spotless` will format all files according to the line endings defined in the `.gitattributes` file. This means, we need to keep `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files in separate blocks, since the first found line ending is used for all files in the `includes` block.
